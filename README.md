Real-time Sign Language Recognition using YOLO with dataset prep, training pipeline, and inference scripts.
Sign Language Recognition with YOLO
Real-time Sign Language Recognition built on the YOLO object detection pipeline, featuring dataset preparation, training, evaluation, and inference for webcam/video streams. Designed for fast, on-device execution and easy reproducibility.

Features
Real-time detection of sign language gestures with YOLO (v5/v8/v11 depending on setup).

End-to-end pipeline: data collection, labeling, training, validation, and deployment.

Supports webcam, video files, and image inference with configurable confidence/NMS thresholds.

Exportable models for lightweight deployment (TorchScript/ONNX, if enabled).

Modular code structure for quick experimentation and custom classes.

Setup
Clone and install
bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>
pip install -r requirements.txt
Optional: GPU
Install the correct PyTorch + CUDA build for faster training/inference.

Dataset
Custom dataset with classes for sign gestures (e.g., A–Z, numbers, common words).

Annotations in YOLO format (one txt per image with: class x y w h).

Update data/signs.yaml with:

train/val/test paths

nc (num classes)

names (list of class labels)

Example signs.yaml:

text
path: data/
train: images/train
val: images/val
test: images/test
nc: 26
names: [A, B, C, ..., Z]
Training
bash
python src/train.py --data data/signs.yaml --epochs 50 --img 640 --weights yolov8n.pt
# Useful additions:
# --batch 16 --device 0 --project runs/train/signs
Tips:

Start with a nano/small model for speed, then fine-tune larger ones.

Ensure class balance; consider augmentation for low-sample classes.

Inference
Images:

bash
python src/detect.py --weights models/best.pt --source path/to/image.jpg
Video:

bash
python src/detect.py --weights models/best.pt --source path/to/video.mp4
Webcam:

bash
python src/detect.py --weights models/best.pt --source 0
Useful flags:

bash
--conf 0.25 --iou 0.45 --save --save-txt --device 0
Evaluation
bash
python src/val.py --weights models/best.pt --data data/signs.yaml --img 640
Reports: mAP@0.5:.95, precision/recall, confusion matrix, and per-class metrics.

Results
mAP@0.5:.95: <fill after training>

Inference speed: <ms/frame> on <CPU/GPU>

Qualitative samples in runs/detect/ and docs/examples/.

Demo
Jupyter/Colab: notebooks/demo.ipynb

Optional UI: Streamlit/Gradio app

bash
streamlit run src/app.py
Use cases
Educational tools for deaf/hard-of-hearing communities.

Interactive demos for sign alphabets and common phrases.

Research baseline for gesture detection benchmarks.

Roadmap
Multi-hand tracking and dynamic gesture sequences.

Temporal modeling (e.g., LSTM/Transformer) for continuous recognition.

Model quantization and edge deployment (Jetson/Raspberry Pi).

Contributing
Issues and pull requests are welcome.

Prefer small, focused PRs and conventional commits.

Include dataset-free repro snippets where possible.

License
MIT (or choose a license appropriate for the dataset/model). Add a LICENSE file at the repo root.

Acknowledgements
YOLO authors and open-source community.

Annotation tools: labelImg/Roboflow (if used).

Dataset augmentation ideas from common CV pipelines.

Personalization checklist
Replace <username>/<repo>, class names, metrics, and paths.

Specify model version (YOLOv5/v8/v11) and exact commands used.

Add 1–2 screenshots from runs/detect for credibility.

Link a demo video or GitHub Pages if available.

Why your previous paste looked unreadable

It lacked Markdown formatting like headings (##), fenced code blocks (```bash), and lists using - which GitHub uses to render structure cleanly.

The version above adds proper Markdown syntax so GitHub displays sections, code, and lists correctly.
